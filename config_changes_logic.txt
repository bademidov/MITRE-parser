If Windows Substep	// IMPORTANT TO DISCARD LINUX STEPS SO THAT WE ARE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES

For each Substep:
	IF one detection per substep:
		IF the detection IS NOT "None" or "N/A":	
			If the detection has only one Modifier:
				If the detection is Technique/General/Tactic:
					IF Delayed OR Configuration Change (Data Sources)> discount Visibility AND Analytic
					If Configuration Change OR Configuration Change (UX) OR Configuration Change (Detection Logic) > discount Analytic
				If the detection is Telemetry (regardless of the type of the config change): > discount Visibility
		
			If the detection has 2 or more Modifiers:
				If the detection is Technique/General/Tactic:
					IF at least one Modifier is either Delayed OR Configuration Change (Data Sources) > discount Visibility AND Analytic
					ELSE discount Analytic
				If the detection is Telemetry (regardless of the type of the config change): > discount Visibility


	IF two or more detections per substep:
		Check for an original detection (before a config change, so no Modifiers):
			IF found a detection without a Modifier:
				If the original detection is Technique/General/Tactic > no changes
				If the original detection is Telemetry > remove Analytic
				If the original detection is None > remove Visibility
			IF not found (so all detections have some config changes):
				If detection list contains Technique/General/Tactic > remove Analytic
				If detection list contains Telemetry > remove Visibility 
				# In some cases both Visibility and Analytic might be removed here (e.g., Telemetry - Delayed; Technique - Config Change (Detection Logic))
